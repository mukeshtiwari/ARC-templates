abstract = {Ever since their introduction, zero-knowledge proofs have become an important tool for addressing privacy and scalability concerns in a variety of applications. In many systems each client downloads and verifies every new proof, and so proofs must be small and cheap to verify. The most practical schemes require either a trusted setup, as in (pre-processing) zk-SNARKs, or verification complexity that scales linearly with the complexity of the relation, as in Bulletproofs. The structured reference strings required by most zk-SNARK schemes can be constructed with multi-party computation protocols, but the resulting parameters are specific to an individual relation. Groth et al. discovered a zk-SNARK protocol with a universal structured reference string that is also updatable, but the string scales quadratically in the size of the supported relations.Here we describe a zero-knowledge SNARK, Sonic, which supports a universal and continually updatable structured reference string that scales linearly in size. We also describe a generally useful technique in which untrusted "helpers" can compute advice that allows batches of proofs to be verified more efficiently. Sonic proofs are constant size, and in the "helped" batch verification context the marginal cost of verification is comparable with the most efficient SNARKs in the literature.},

Powerful cryptographic techniques for verifying the integrity of electronic voting have been developed and are in increasingly common use. The claimed security guarantees of most of these techniques have been formally proved. However, implementing the cryptographic verifiers which utilize these techniques is a technical and error prone process, and often leads to critical errors appearing in the gap between the implementation and the formally verified design. We significantly reduce the gap between theory and practice by using machine checked proofs coupled with code extraction to produce cryptographic verifiers that are themselves formally verified. We demonstrate the feasibility of our technique by producing a formally verified verifier which we use to check the 2018 International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) directors election.},

abstract={The correctness of vote counting in electronic election is one of the main pillars that engenders trust in electronic elections. However, the present state of the art in vote counting leaves much to be desired: while some jurisdictions publish the source code of vote counting code, others treat the code as commercial in confidence. None of the systems in use today applies any formal verification. In this paper, we formally specify the so-called Schulze method, a vote counting scheme that is gaining popularity in the open-source community. The cornerstone of our formalization is a (dependent, inductive) type that represents all correct executions of the vote counting scheme. Every inhabitant of this type not only gives a final result but also all intermediate steps that lead to this result, and can be externally verified. As a consequence, we do not even need to trust the execution of the (verified) algorithm: the correctness of a particular run of the vote counting code can be verified on the basis of the evidence for correctness that is produced along with the determination of election winners.},

The resulting system significantly improves upon existing approaches, which suffer from a linear number of modular exponentiations in the total number of attributes. This limitation makes them unfit for many practical applications, such as electronic identity cards. Our novel approach can incorporate a large number of binary and finite-set attributes without significant performance impact. It compresses all such attributes into a single attribute base and, thus, boosts the efficiency of all proofs of possession. The core idea is to encode discrete binary and finite-set values as prime numbers. We then use the divisibility property for efficient proofs of their presence or absence. In addition, we contribute efficient methods for conjunctions and disjunctions. The system builds on the strong RSA assumption. We demonstrate the aptness of our method in realistic application scenarios, notably electronic identity cards, and show its advantages for small devices, such as smartcards and cell phones.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient anonymous, attribute-based credential scheme capable of provisioning multi-level credential delegations. It is integrated with a mechanism to revoke the anonymity of credentials for resolving access disputes and making users accountable for their actions. The proposed scheme has a lower end-user computational complexity in comparison to existing credential schemes with delegatability and has a comparable level of performance with the credential standards of U-Prove and Idemix. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed scheme can be applied to a collaborative e-health environment to provide its users with the necessary anonymous access with delegation capabilities.},

abstract = {Decentralized Anonymous Credential (DAC) has posed enormous potential in smart grids for protecting user privacy (e.g. preventing user’s daily life from being sketched out). However, the existing DAC protocols still compromise user privacy for a full list of attributes are disclosed during showing credentials. In this paper, to construct a privacy-enhancing decentralized anonymous credential (PEDAC) protocol, we first design a more efficient range proof to hide user’s attributes. Specifically, we are inspired by Camenisch et al. (ASIACRYPT 2008), but replace their adopted Boneh-Boyen signature scheme with the Chinese standard SM2 signature scheme (incorporated in the ISO/IEC 14888-3) to propose pairing-free set membership and range proof protocols. These protocols can be executed non-interactively upon the Fiat-Shamir heuristic (INDOCRYPT 2012), and then be used to construct our PEDAC protocol. By compared with the protocols of Camenisch et al. (ASIACRYPT 2008) and Poelstra et al. (FC 2018), our proposed range proofs are with less communication and computation costs and hence more practical for constructing PEDAC protocols in smart grids.}

abstract = {HACL* is a verified portable C cryptographic library that implements modern cryptographic primitives such as the ChaCha20 and Salsa20 encryption algorithms, Poly1305 and HMAC message authentication, SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash functions, the Curve25519 elliptic curve, and Ed25519 signatures.HACL* is written in the F* programming language and then compiled to readable C code. The F* source code for each cryptographic primitive is verified for memory safety, mitigations against timing side-channels, and functional correctness with respect to a succinct high-level specification of the primitive derived from its published standard. The translation from F* to C preserves these properties and the generated C code can itself be compiled via the CompCert verified C compiler or mainstream compilers like GCC or CLANG. When compiled with GCC on 64-bit platforms, our primitives are as fast as the fastest pure C implementations in OpenSSL and libsodium, significantly faster than the reference C code in TweetNaCl, and between 1.1x-5.7x slower than the fastest hand-optimized vectorized assembly code in SUPERCOP.HACL* implements the NaCl cryptographic API and can be used as a drop-in replacement for NaCl libraries like libsodium and TweetNaCl. HACL* provides the cryptographic components for a new mandatory ciphersuite in TLS 1.3 and is being developed as the main cryptographic provider for the miTLS verified implementation. Primitives from HACL* are also being integrated within Mozilla's NSS cryptographic library. Our results show that writing fast, verified, and usable C cryptographic libraries is now practical.},

This paper presents a formal verification with the Coq proof assistant
of a memory model for C-like imperative languages. This model defines
the memory layout and the operations that manage the memory. The model
has been specified at two levels of abstraction and implemented as
part of an ongoing certification in Coq of a moderately-optimising C
compiler. Many properties of the memory have been verified in the
specification. They facilitate the definition of precise formal
semantics of C pointers. A certified OCaml code implementing the
memory model has been automatically extracted from the
specifications.},

abstract="cminor is a mid-level imperative programming language; there are proved-correct optimizing compilers from C to cminor and from cminor to machine language. We have redesigned cminor so that it is suitable for Hoare Logic reasoning and we have designed a Separation Logic for cminor. In this paper, we give a small-step semantics (instead of the big-step of the proved-correct compiler) that is motivated by the need to support future concurrent extensions. We detail a machine-checked proof of soundness of our Separation Logic. This is the first large-scale machine-checked proof of a Separation Logic w.r.t. a small-step semantics. The work presented in this paper has been carried out in the Coq proof assistant. It is a first step towards an environment in which concurrent cminor programs can be verified using Separation Logic and also compiled by a proved-correct compiler with formal end-to-end correctness guarantees.",

abstract="Most methods of data transmission and storage are prone to errors, leading to data loss. Forward erasure correction (FEC) is a method to allow data to be recovered in the presence of errors by encoding the data with redundant parity information determined by an error-correcting code. There are dozens of classes of such codes, many based on sophisticated mathematics, making them difficult to verify using automated tools. In this paper, we present a formal, machine-checked proof of a C implementation of FEC based on Reed-Solomon coding. The C code has been actively used in network defenses for over 25 years, but the algorithm it implements was partially unpublished, and it uses certain optimizations whose correctness was unknown even to the code's authors. We use Coq's Mathematical Components library to prove the algorithm's correctness and the Verified Software Toolchain to prove that the C program correctly implements this algorithm, connecting both using a modular, well-encapsulated structure that could easily be used to verify a high-speed, hardware version of this FEC. This is the first end-to-end, formal proof of a real-world FEC implementation; we verified all previously unknown optimizations and found a latent bug in the code.",
