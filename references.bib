The size of the non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments can even be reduced to a constant

rely on groups with pairings and security is based on two new cryptographic assumptions; 
we do not use the Fiat-Shamir heuristic or random oracles.},

A proof attesting to the satisfiability of n constraints has size \$O(\log^2 n)\$; it can be produced with \$O(n\log n)\$ field operations and verified with \$O(n)\$. At 128 bits of security, proofs are less than 250kB even for several million constraints, more than 10 times shorter than prior SNARGs with similar features.},

abstract = {Ever since their introduction, zero-knowledge proofs have become an important tool for addressing privacy and scalability concerns in a variety of applications. In many systems each client downloads and verifies every new proof, and so proofs must be small and cheap to verify. The most practical schemes require either a trusted setup, as in (pre-processing) zk-SNARKs, or verification complexity that scales linearly with the complexity of the relation, as in Bulletproofs. The structured reference strings required by most zk-SNARK schemes can be constructed with multi-party computation protocols, but the resulting parameters are specific to an individual relation. Groth et al. discovered a zk-SNARK protocol with a universal structured reference string that is also updatable, but the string scales quadratically in the size of the supported relations.Here we describe a zero-knowledge SNARK, Sonic, which supports a universal and continually updatable structured reference string that scales linearly in size. We also describe a generally useful technique in which untrusted "helpers" can compute advice that allows batches of proofs to be verified more efficiently. Sonic proofs are constant size, and in the "helped" batch verification context the marginal cost of verification is comparable with the most efficient SNARKs in the literature.},

A distinctive feature of Spartan is that it offers the first zkSNARKs without trusted setup (i.e., transparent zkSNARKs) for NP where verifying a proof incurs sub-linear costs---without requiring uniformity in the NP statement's structure. Furthermore, Spartan offers zkSNARKs with a time-optimal prover, a property that has remained elusive for nearly all zkSNARKs in the literature.},
